             THE LICENSE OF POKER-EVAL IS GPLv3-or-later

This File: Canonically, this file is "LICENSE" at top level, but a copy
           is made to "COPYING" for historical reasons.

Short version: The effective license of the whole work, when copied,
               modified, conveyed, propogated and/or redistributed is
               GPLv3-or-later.  More details of the licensing follows.

Details follow:

poker-eval was, years ago, released GPLv2-only.  In March 2008, Loic
Dachary contacted all prior copyright holders and got assent for
GPLv3-or-later.  The file GPLv3-assent.txt contains that email
correspondence.

poker-eval is thus GPLv3-or-later.  A full copy of GPLv3 is in the file
"GPLv3".  Here is the copyright and license notice for the whole package.
(If you are an author submitting a patch, be sure to add your copyright
