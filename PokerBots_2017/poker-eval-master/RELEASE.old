poker-eval-120 (25 Jun 2002)
============================
Added java layer with JNI connection to C hand evaluation library; the
java code has both javadoc comments and junit-based unit tests.
Implemented holdem hand groups, belief vectors, and subjective all-in
equity (SAIE) calculations.  Added 'saie' example script.  Fixed a bug
that unnecessarily enumerated all permutations of cards to come in
stud and draw games; now we simply count combinations, speeding up
pokenum.  Fixed some other minor bugs.

Release 1.2.0 has not been tested in any Windows environment and probably
fails to build.  Use release 1.1.0 if you can only run under Windows.


poker-eval-110 (15 Apr 2002)
============================
Added Omaha/Omaha8, JokerHigh, and Joker 8-or-better low
evaluation.  Added a new enumeration layer, plus a
montecarlo sampling option.  Added new examples pokenum,
usedecks, and utest1.  Removed cmpN.c, which wasn't
compatible with the current library.  Updated documentation.
