# Johnny Harv's Bodacious Poker Tour Goes Computational
Poker AI

Our goal is to further our understanding of how we make decisions under pressure with imperfect information by studying the game of poker. Even if you play the game a lot, it's difficult to crystallize exactly why and how you make certain decisions in different situations. Are there other strategies you, or people in general, might be missing? Our hope is that in the process of programming an agent to play, or learn how to play, poker we might improve our understanding of the game and our own decision making processes.

This repository contains:

1. Code to manage poker (no-limit Texas Hold'em) games between multiple agents. Games are managed, in large part, using the API made available by the Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC) [1]. This API was written by the Computer Poker Research Group at the University of Alberta [2]. This code was edited by Surge Biswas to simplify the interface for compatibility with higher level languages (e.g. R and Python). 

2. Community submitted computational poker agents.
